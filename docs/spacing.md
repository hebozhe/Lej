# Spacing

Lej has a flexible spacing policy. Whitespace is used to separate tokens, but the amount of whitespace is not important. This means that you can use as much or as little whitespace as you like, as long as it separates tokens.

The key benefit of this policy is that Lej code can be minified.

A linter for Lej will enforce an opinionated spacing policy, but the compiler will not care about the amount of whitespace in your code.
