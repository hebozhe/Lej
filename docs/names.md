# Names (Identifiers)

Names are used to identify variables, functions, modules, and other entities in Lej.

## Naming Format

Names in Lej must adhere to the following rules:
1. A name _cannot_ be a reserved keyword.
    - This is self-enforcing. If a name is a reserved keyword, it will be rejected by the parser.
2. A name must start with a lowercase letter.
3. A name can contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, or numbers after the first character.
4. Nothing else is allowed.

This is known as the _camelCase_ naming convention.
